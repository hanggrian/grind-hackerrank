# Subarray Division<sup style="color: rgb(32, 215, 97);">Easy</sup>

> Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares
  has an integer on it.
>
> Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that:
>
> - The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
> - The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.
>
> Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.
>
> **Example**
>
> \\(s = [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]\\)
>
> \\(d = 4\\)
>
> \\(m = 2\\)
>
> Lily wants to find segments summing to Ron's birth day, \\(d = 4\\) with a
  length equalling his brith month, \\(m = 2\\). In this case, there are two
  segments meeting her criteria: \\([2, 2]\\) and \\([1, 3]\\).
