# Mini-Max Sum<sup style="color: rgb(32, 215, 97);">Easy</sup>

> Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be
  calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the
  respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated
  long integers.
>
> **Example**
>
> \\(arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\\)
>
> The minimum sum is \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16\\) and the maximum sum is
  \\(3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24\\). The function prints:
>
> ```
> 16 24
> ```
>
> **Function Description**
>
> Complete the \\(miniMaxSum\\) function with the following parameter(s):
>
> - \\(arr[5]\\): an array of \\(5\\) integers
>
> **Print**
>
> Print two space-separated integers on one line: the minimum sum and the maximum
  sum of \\(4\\) of \\(5\\) elements. No value should be returned.
>
> **Note:** For some languages, like C, C++, and Java, the sums may require that
  you use a long integer due to their size.
