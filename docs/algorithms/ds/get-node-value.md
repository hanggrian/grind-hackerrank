# Get Node Value<sup style="color: rgb(32, 215, 97);">Easy</sup>

> This challenge is part of a tutorial track by [MyCodeSchool](http://www.youtube.com/mycodeschool)
>
> Given a pointer to the head of a linked list and a specific position,
  determine the data value at that position. Count backwards from the tail node.
  The tail is at postion 0, its parent is at 1 and so on.
>
> **Example**
>
> \\(head\\) refers to \\(3 \to 2 \to 1 \to 0 \to NULL\\)
>
> \\(positionFromTail = 2\\)
>
> Each of the data values matches its distance from the tail. The value \\(2\\)
  is at the desired position.
