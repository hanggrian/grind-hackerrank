# Balanced Brackets<sup style="color: rgb(219, 113, 0);">Medium</sup>

> A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, },
  [, or ].
>
> Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket
  (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or })
  of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets:
  [], {}, and ().
>
> A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses
  are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in
  between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a
  single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a
  single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].
>
> By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following
  conditions are met:
>
> - It contains no unmatched brackets.
> - The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of
    brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
>
> Given \\(n\\) strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets
  is balanced. If a string is balanced, return `YES`. Otherwise, return `NO`.
