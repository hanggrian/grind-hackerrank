> You are given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to
  add to the list. Create a new node with the given integer. Insert this node at
  the tail of the linked list and return the head node of the linked list formed
  after inserting this new node. The given head pointer may be null, meaning
  that the initial list is empty.
