# Array Manipulation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 81, 107);">Hard</sup>

> Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each
  operation add a value to each array element between two given indices,
  inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value
  in the array.

> **Example**
>
> \\(n = 10\\)

> \\(queries = [(1, 5, 3), (4, 8, 7), (6, 9, 1)]\\)

> Queries are interpreted as follows:

> ```
>     a b k
>     1 5 3
>     4 8 7
>     6 9 1

> Add the values of \\(k\\) between the indices \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):
