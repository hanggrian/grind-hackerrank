> Given a pointer to the head of a linked list, insert a new node before the
  head. The \\(next\\) value in the new node should point to \\(head\\) and the
  \\(data\\) value should be replaced with a given value. Return a reference to
  the new head of the list. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the
  initial list is empty.
