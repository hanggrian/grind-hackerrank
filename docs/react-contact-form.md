> You need to create a simple React application called "Contact Form" that
  collects user information and displays it below the form upon submission. This
  task will help you practice handling form inputs, validation, and conditional
  rendering in React.

>     - The form should have the following fields:
>     - **Name:** Text input for the user's name.
>     - **Email:** Text input for the user's email address.
>     - **Message:** Textarea for the user's message.
> 1.  **Form Submission:**
>     - There should be a "Submit" button to submit the form.
> 1.  **Form Validation:**
>     - Validate that none of the fields are empty upon submission.
>     - If any field is empty, display an error message: "All fields are
        required." The form should not be submitted.
> 1.  Displaying Submitted Data:
>     - If the form is successfully submitted, display the entered information
        below the form.
