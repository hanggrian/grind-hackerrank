# React Article Sorting<sup style="color: rgb(255, 81, 107);">Hard</sup>

> Create a React application called "Article Sorting" that displays a list of
  articles and allows users to sort them based on upvotes and publication date.
  Some core functionalities have already been implemented, but the application
  is not complete. Application requirements are detailed below, and the finished
  application must pass all of the unit tests.

> **Detailed Requirements**
>
> 1.  The Articles component takes an array of articles as a prop. Each element
      of this array is an object with three properties: a string title, a number
      upvotes, and a string date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
> 1.  By default, the articles should be displayed in a table ordered by the
      number of upvotes in descending order.
> 1.  Clicking on the "Most Upvoted" button should reorder and display the
      articles by the number of upvotes in descending order.
> 1.  Clicking on the "Most Recent" button should reorder and display the
      articles by date in descending order.
> 1.  You can assume that each article has a unique publish date and number of
      upvotes.
