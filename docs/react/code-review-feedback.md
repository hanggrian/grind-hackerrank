> **Detailed Requirements**
>
> 1.  The CodeReviewFeedback component displays five aspects: Readability,
      Performance, Security, Documentation, and Testing.
> 1.  Each aspect has two buttons labeled "Upvote" and "Downvote" to allow users
      to vote.
> 1.  The initial count for upvotes and downvotes for each aspect is set to
      zero.
> 1.  Clicking the "Upvote" button should increment the upvote count for that
      aspect by 1.
> 1.  Clicking the "Downvote" button should increment the downvote count for
      that aspect by 1.
> 1.  Ensure the counts update in the UI immediately upon clicking.
>
> The component should have a subtle animation when the voting count is updated
  to enhance the user experience.
